We started our journey of creating games 6 years ago, created one game in the \"quiz\"\n              genre and then created a game in the \"click\" genre, but we were not destined to finish it for various\n              reasons. After that we took a break for 6 years, and now we are returning.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className={s.block}>\n            <p className={s.text}>\n              We come back with a new approach, New ideas, New experience and knowledge in creating games.
